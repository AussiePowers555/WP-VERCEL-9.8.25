## Environment Variables Required
Add these to your Vercel environment variables:

```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Stripe Account

- Get your API keys from Stripe Dashboard > Developers > API keys

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create Stripe Products
Run the setup script to create products and prices in your Stripe account:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/setup-stripe-products.ts
```

**Important**: Copy the generated Price IDs and update them in `lib/stripe.ts`

### 4. Configure Webhooks
In your Stripe Dashboard:
- Go to Developers > Webhooks
- Add endpoint: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe`

- Copy the webhook secret to your environment variables

### 5. Test the System

2. Select a plan to test Stripe Checkout
3. Use Stripe test cards for testing
