# CRITICAL BUG REPORT - Case Management Dropdown Persistence Issues

## BUG-010: Critical Dropdown Persistence Failures
- **Reported by**: Michael - Lead Developer  
- **Date**: 2025-08-08
- **Severity**: MISSION CRITICAL - Production Blocker
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS

### Symptoms Identified:
1. **Workspace Assignment Not Persisting**:
   - Selecting "Martin Lawyers Workspace" from dropdown doesn't update database
   - Workspace remains empty when navigating to workspace page
   - Shows "undefined: undefined" in workspace description

2. **Lawyer/Rental/Insurance Dropdowns Not Persisting**:
   - Selections are not saved to database
   - Navigating away and returning shows "No lawyer", "No rental company", "No insurer"
   - All dropdown selections are forgotten on page navigation

3. **Main Workspace Display Issue**:
   - Main workspace shows no cases initially
   - Must click "Clear Filter" to see cases
   - Should show all cases by default without needing to clear filter

4. **Real-time Update Failure**:
   - Database not listening for dropdown changes
   - No immediate persistence when selections are made
   - UI updates optimistically but database remains unchanged

### Root Causes Identified:
1. **API Call Failures**: 
   - handleWorkspaceAssignment, handleLawyerAssignment, handleRentalCompanyAssignment may be failing silently
   - No error handling or user feedback when API calls fail
   - Optimistic UI updates mask database persistence failures

2. **Context Issues**:
   - WorkspaceContext showing "undefined: undefined" suggests context value problems
   - Workspace name not properly retrieved from context

3. **Database Column Mismatches**:
   - Possible mismatch between frontend field names and database columns
   - workspace_id vs workspaceId inconsistencies

4. **Filter State Issues**:
   - Main workspace incorrectly applying filters on initial load
   - Filter state not properly initialized

### Files Affected:
- `src/app/(app)/cases/cases-list-client.tsx` - Main component with dropdowns
- `src/app/api/cases/[id]/route.ts` - API endpoint for updates
- `src/contexts/WorkspaceContext.tsx` - Context provider
- `src/lib/database.ts` - Database update functions

### Fix Strategy:
1. Add proper error handling and user feedback to all assignment functions
2. Ensure API calls are actually succeeding
3. Fix workspace context to properly provide workspace name
4. Ensure Main Workspace shows all cases by default
5. Add logging to track persistence failures
6. Verify database column names match frontend field names

### Testing Requirements:
1. Select workspace dropdown → Verify persists and shows in workspace page
2. Select lawyer dropdown → Navigate away and back → Verify selection persists
3. Select rental company → Navigate away and back → Verify selection persists  
4. Select insurer → Navigate away and back → Verify selection persists
5. Load Main Workspace → Verify shows all cases without clearing filter
6. Load specific workspace → Verify shows only assigned cases

### Production Impact:
- **CRITICAL**: Core functionality broken
- Users cannot assign cases to workspaces
- Users cannot assign lawyers/rental companies/insurers
- Data integrity compromised
- Workflow completely blocked
